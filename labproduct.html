                        <p>Our product is an installation representing a blanket hut from our childhood - 
                            the secret and safe place that allows people to escape reality and create their universe. 
                            After participants open the curtain and step inside, they will get surrounded by a sea of clouds and be able to interact with different sensors to 
                            make their combination of lights, 
                            sound, and visual patterns.</p>

                        How the installation works & how users interact with it: <br>
                        <p>In our installation, multiple sensors are twisted with different shapes and
                            wrapped with aluminum foil. These sensors represented either light, sound, or visual
                            patterns. In other words, when participants touch the sensor, a corresponding effect will be
                            exhibited. <br>
                            For the light setting, 3 LED strips are attached to the board with the cotton cloud and 6
                            touchpoints were
                            assigned to a specific section of the led strips. Each touchpoint can change the color of
                            its corresponding area. <br>

                            4 touch points are assigned to different types of sound, which are beat, guitar and
                            melodies. Each touchpoint consists of other three options; it can be switched when the user
                            interacts with the touch point. <br>

                            There is another touchpoint that connects to the visual pattern. The pattern is displayed
                            through the monitor at the top and the user can switch to a new pattern by touching the wire
                            as well. <br>

                        What I observed from our participants:<br>
                        <p>Most visitors were curious about our installation as we covered the whole setup
                            with a black blanket. We intended to mimic a childhood-like blanket and pillow house and spark people's inner child. I thought people of older age (e.g., parents)
                            might find it more resonated, but I found that they felt slightly hesitant about going
                            inside or even worried
                            if they would mess up anything. Eventually, their children or we had to convince and tell
                            them to relax and touch anything they wanted. It was an interesting reaction to see
                            , actually and it also made me reflect on the importance of the overall installation setup.
                            Because of our timeframe and budget,
                            we could only build a small hut (max three ppl inside) and cover it with a whole piece of black
                            blanket. I can see why some people would feel unsure, but I also believe that this problem
                            can be improved if we could upgrade the installation outlook. After all, I guess "don't judge the book by its 
                            cover" isn't valid all the time :p Sometimes you need to create a setting that can spark people's curiosity and simultaneously be welcoming. <br>
                            As in the experience inside the hut, I'm glad to see smiley faces from people :) Combining LED light strips with 
                            a layer of cotton creates a dreamy vibe to the environment. However, it was a shame that some sensors didn't perform 
                            stability sometimes. We believe it could be because some of the sensors were too far from the LED strip, and since we soldered multiple wires 
                            to extend the length, it would take longer to react to it. Because of this, we sometimes need to stay next to the participants and explain. <br>
                            Another thing that I observed is that - people interacted more with the light and visual patterns. Part of the reason is that the EXPO environment had too many 
                            different sound sources. It is hard to focus and hear the sound from our side. On the other hand, it might be nice to focus on two effects (light and visual patterns) and provide 
                            more variations rather than covering too many different things. After all, the sound is a nice effect, but this could be the background audio, or each particular sound or melody follows with a slight variation. 
                            In this case, the combination of different sensations can be more coherent.
