							<h2><b>Artifical creatures</h2></b>
						</div>

						<br>
						<h4><b>A. Homeostasis model</b></h4>
						<b>Bicycle</b><br>
						<img src="img/portfolio/creature/graph.png" width ="90%"><br><br>
						1. The needs of the bike to perform its primary function:<br>
						<p> a. Stability: it will be gained through forward momentum. Controlling the speed of the bike
							between
							a lower and upper threshold is necessary to achieve this need.<br>
							b. Direction: Changing direction by steering and simultaneously changing the centre of mass
							of the
							bike by leaning to the left or right.<br>
							c. Safety/selfpreservation: The need of the bike to survive and avoid incidents is vital to achieve its primary functions.
							Communicating its intent to other traffic in a complex environment to avoid collisions or incidents is therefore needed.   </p>


						2. These needs are influenced by:<br>
						<p>a. Natural forces such as wind. Balancing the centre of mass to counteract this outside
							force keeps the bike going.<br>
							b. Obstacles. Controlling speed by using the brakes OR changing direction. Braking might
							cause
							the bike to go beyond the lower speed threshold forcing the bicyclist to place their
							feet on
							the ground. Alternatively, the bike can change directions by steering. The combined
							centre
							of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it.
							This
							lean is induced by a method known as ‘counter steering’,
							which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands or
							indirectly by leaning the bicycle.<br>
							c. Other bikes and traffic. A bike does not function in a vacuum, but is nearly always using public space. 
							This means using sounds like ringing the bell are needed to operate safely. </p>

						3. How the bike behaves like a creature with the model ;)<br>
						<p>The fascinating creature known by many as the ‘bike’ has begun its yearly migration towards
							HHS, facing many dangers and obstacles along the way.
							First, the bike encouters a heavy gust of wind. Sensing the eb and flow of nature, the bike
							leans gracefully into the wind,
							balancing its centre of mass. The wind seems to have distracted a pedestrian who hasn't seen the bike. 
							The bike rings to avoid a collision. Then all out of a sudden, a car steers along the corner
							crossing the path of the bike.
							The bike reacts quickly and uses its brakes to slow down the speed, avoiding the car. 
							Finally, the university is in sight and on the right side of the bike. The bike
							countersteers to the left and changes
							its centre of mass to the right, thereby successfully initiating the turn.
							The bike has reached its destination and has satisfied all its needs by balancing its
							internal state.</p>


						<h4><b>B. Research</b></h4>
						<p><b> Texture-changing robot skin</b></p>
						<div class="project-details-meta">
							<span><b>Maker:</b> Engineering students from Cornell University </span>
							<span><a href="http://guyhoffman.com/goosebumps-texture-changing-robotic-skin/">
									Article link & photos source</a></span>
						</div>

						<p> Most of the robots we know often appears with a hard or metal skin. However, in this
							example, the
							team creates a soft outer skin robot that the texture will be varied based on how the robot
							itself wants the user to interact with it.
							Although the idea of social robot isn't an entirely new technology, most of them express its
							internal state by facial expression and gesture only.
							The inspiration behind this idea is from observing how human interact with animal species
							and also how internal states can be seen from skin changes.
							For example, human gets goosebumps when we feel cold or even terrified; a blowfish becomes
							spiky when it feels threatened.
							Therefore, integrating texture changing skin is such a decent details and acts as a new
							channel for communicating with human.
						</p>

						<p>This idea is only a prototype so far, the team has engineered how the robot works under
							goosebumps and spikes situation and it is not a fully functionable robot at this moment.
							Therefore, I couldn't find too much details in regard of how it works technically in a deep
							level. But I have at least found out how they made the prototype
							was by using multiple sheets of air pockets that can allow different textures to be
							generated in various patterns. User can also see the screen of the robot to observe
							its facial expression to react based upon it. </p>

						<p>This example has given me another perspective that us, as a human doesn't necessary to be the
							prior group to be beneficial. So far we have different social robots or even service that
							help us improving social life and interaction, yet sometimes we might forget there are other
							species in the environment or even robots. I'm looking forward to see how this prototype
							will be expanded
							and implemented into robots (they have started expanding :D), after all I believe this idea
							will allow us to gain a deeper understanding and empathy towards
							objects and environment around us.</p>

						<h4><b>C: Reflection</b></h4>
						<p><b>What did you think of this topic?</b></p>
						<p>Impressive! I came from the generation that dancing teletubbies doll with music was the "high
							tech creature". Now seeing
							all different examples of how technology has been greatly integrated that can actually
							create meaningfull interactions among people,
							animals or any tiny parts in the environment has really blown my mind. However, i do have
							similar concern of what I had from the XR topic. I'm not sure
							whether technology has become such an important weight in our life is a good thing or not. I
							looked for more videos about AI and robot, and I get the theory behind that
							robots only execute the command we programme into it. Deep inside myself, I'm just a bit worried that powerful technology would land in 
						people with bad hands. (I don't mean to be dark, but where I come from has given me such a lesson that it is somewhat possible.) And in a lighter extend,
						 would people rely too much on technology (artifical creatures in this case) and assume it is the only way to improve an issue. Like, 
						 when there is robot that can faciliate eldery's life, will people has the tendency of caring less? All in all, i think this is 
					also a great opportunity for me as a designer to evaluate and reflect more of how we can apply technology in a responsible way and still allow us to take 
					most authority of our action.  </p>

					<p><b>How do you see applications and the future of this? </b></p>
					<p>My above answer has included some opinions for this question :) But at the same time, when i am imagining, i see this application will extend to more industries in the near future, e.g. 
						medical and service-based. Robot/artifical creatures nowadays are no longer responding in a passive way, it can actually detect a lot of things that ourselves haven't noticed 
						immediately and act upon or even to provide professional helps right away. One idea i just came up with is that, a lot of children doesn't like going to clinic or hospital and would trigger 
						their sense of fear. Perhaps at the near future there would be a cute-like creature that can handle normal sickness; the child only need to pet it or so and it can detect what kind of sickness and 
						what the child need.

					<p><b>Did the subject meet your expectations?</b></p>
					<p>Certainly!</p>
