                        <h3><b>III. Reflect</b></h3>
                        Are you content with your product? And why? Does it achieve what you set out to do?<br>
                        <p>I'm content with the installation, especially if you'd consider that we started with no clue how to turn on a tiny LED pin and ended up creating a 'sea of luminescent clouds.' Our group has tried its best to break through and progress. It has certainly achieved what we set out to do: creating a comfy, dreamy cloud environment, allowing users to interact with sensors to make their favorite combination with lights, sounds, and visual patterns. During the Expo, we also received a lot of positive feedback. Our participants did have a great time when they experienced our installation. However, I think it still lacks the element of childhood or inner child. The installation was covered by a blanket and included a floor of pillows underneath. But with how it looks at the end, it feels like a standard setting rather than the blanket/pillow hut we would build when we were kids. From my point of view, it is not necessary to illustrate all the concepts with 100% how it looks in real life. 
                            But if it is one of the "selling points," then it should be created in a more concrete context..</p><br><br>

                        What is the quality of your product? Try to quantify/objectively express this.<br>
                        <p>In terms of the quality of the product, I would say it is decent but can also be improved.<br>
                        What is in good quality:<br>
                        • Installation built with a solid and safe structure: Although the walls of our installation were made of two tables, they are very sturdy, and we tested them out by using some heavy materials beforehand. We also added more tough wooden blocks at the bottom 
                            so that the angle of the table legs is at the same horizontal view. Before placing pillows, we put a stable pallet for support as well.<br>
                        • The combination of LED strips with a layer of cotton works exceptionally well. It can certainly bring out the dreamy vibe, and our participants enjoyed seeing its variations. The visual patterns also match well with the cloud and the overall environment. 
                            As how they looked was abstract, it had the effect of creating a different universe.<br>
                        • Circuit arrangement was a significant concern, so we ensured there would not be a short circuit situation.<br><br>

                        What can be improved:<br>
                        <p> • As mentioned in the process chapter, some of our capacitive sensors for changing LED lights did not perform stably. We were not aware of the importance of electronics until the very last moment. Thus we couldn't adjust connecting wires and the position of the LED strips. There are a lot of factors that can affect the sensibility, 
                            but one thing that we could plan thoroughly is building the circuit that can carry out the best performance.<br>
                        • The sound environment can be taken into consideration during the Expo: there were many different sources of sound during the Expo. Therefore it could be hard to listen to our sound options. I also think we can let participants know how many options 
                            they can switch per sensor directly. Otherwise, they might feel lost with which soundtrack they were following.</p><br><br>


                        Reflect on the process that you have gone through and compare your work/effort to that of the
                        group<br>
                        <p>During these whole lab weeks, I would say that I had been very honest and open to discussing my concerns, 
                            strengths & weaknesses, and difficulties with my groupmates. During the first few days, 
                            I see myself needing extra time to understand Arduino than my groupmates. I do not take this as an excuse for not learning. 
                            I also tried to catch up and ensure I understood the issues. But compared with Yulia and Hanna, they were actively coming up with the primary approach and looking 
                            for the problems. My role with Arduino was more like an assistant and learner simultaneously. <br>
On the other hand, I'm also proud of myself for finally understanding basic electronics more. I had zero sense of electricity or didn't even know how batteries work. 
                            But throughout the process, I can read up more information, 
                            get the logic behind and think together with the group to look for a solution.<br>

                        I took the most responsibilities with visuals programming and the installation setup. 
                            It was an achievement for me to see how I picked a reference with only a circle to an audio visualizer in the environment 
                            and adapted the frequency spectrum from the environment in Maakhaven to create a landscape. Although these things were not adapted in our installation, I think I have gained a lot during the process and have at least tried my best to explore other possibilities on p5js. In the end, I made all four visual patterns myself and used functions 
                            that I didn't even know before lab weeks on 3 of them. Therefore, I would say that I breakthrough a lot in p5js and processing.<br>

                        Regarding installation setup, I understand that our group has a tight budget and didn't want to spend too much on the project. 
                            Therefore, I took a lot of initiatives to help collect materials around all different places for free, such as the computer monitor, 
                            huge chipboard for attaching LED strips, and most of the pillows. During the last few days, I also saw wooden blocks of the right size, 
                            sanding wood, soldering wires, preparing capacitive sensors, and so on.
</p><br><br>

                        How did you spend your time, tell something about this?<br>
                        <p>On the first day of the lab weeks, I remember feeling very clueless about making a start. I spent some time looking for inspiration, but one of the most beneficial approaches is to think of things I have never tried, read the basics, follow instructions, and then expand the basics as much as possible. Therefore, during the first week, I deep-dived into what I was interested in. I also spent quite a lot of time on tutorials. 
                            I think the importance of tutorials isn't really about following but understanding the logic and applying it in different contexts later on. 
                            When I was watching tutorials, sometimes it also involved other functions that I had never encountered. I'd say that it can drag you into an endless coding sea :D <br>
                            
As mentioned before, I want to understand what my groupmates are working on, and sometimes it might take a longer time for me to achieve that. 
                            I'd also bring the issue back home and research myself or ask for an explanation directly.<br>

                        Not just within the group, I would sometimes walk to other groups and see what they were working on. In the end, we had lots of sharing about how to do this and advised each other. For example, I remember Yulia, and I randomly walked to another group and realized that they were figuring out the relationship between resistance and temperature. 
                            At the end of the conversation, they provided a helpful link for us to look into the concept more.</p><br><br>

                        Were you motivated? Were your expectations met? Did you have a good time? Did you learn a lot?
                        Why? Why not?<br>

                        <p>I was motivated most of the time! During the lab week, I get to find my strengths in visuals and contribute in the way I can. I wish I could work more with LED strips, 
                            but I think everyone has what they are good at, and with teamwork, we also need to learn to divide tasks efficiently.<br>

                        As for the learning outcome, I would say that I didn’t have the same deep understanding about
                        LED strips and MPR121 capacitive settings in Arduino as Yulia, Hanna and Marissa. We received
                        the MPR board 1.5 days before the expo and I didn't get to experiment with it. It is also more
                        realistic if someone good at it/has been focusing on it to take the initiative to fix the
                        problem. Now thinking back about it, I could have also asked for code sharing and understand
                        more of the setting, rather than just reading up text online. However, as mentioned in earlier
                        paragraphs, I have learned a lot with visual programming and basic knowledge of electronics too.<br>

                            It is also more realistic if someone is good at it/has been focusing on it to take the initiative to fix the problem.
I set expectations at the beginning of this course: "I hope I can develop a nice interactive project that is implemented with different technology, 
                            together with other talented students, and to make the users happy." To see how our users interact with our installation, 
                            I think this aim is successfully achieved :) In terms of technology, our group tried to learn new skills we had never tried before and successfully 
                            integrated them into the installation. I believe there are even more types of technology, but I'd say that it was already a challenge with what 
                            we did and a good start for us to dive in more in the future.<br>

I had a good time in general. It feels rewarding to overcome everything till the end! However, there were also moments
                            when I felt not being respected as a team. There was a situation where I recognized some Dutch words, 
                            and I could tell they were discussing one of us. I had to look into their faces and be open to conversation. 
                            It is a collaboration, and if there is something that you prefer to be done differently, it should be voiced out and discussed openly 
                            but not complaining in your language. I also requested to share resources that everyone has, but in the end, I can feel that most people feel very 
                            protective of what they "own." There are certainly some parts that someone took the most responsibilities and it belongs to their work. I can understand that, 
                            but the reason to share was more about understanding the team's current progress and being able to reflect from there. The collaboration part at the end was 
                            disappointing. Still, it has also given me a lesson on the importance of listing what we should share as a team,
                            encouraging more open discussion, and checking in with what frustrations/concerns the team has.</p><br>
