                        <h3><b>III. Reflect</b></h3>
                        Are you content with your product? And why? Does it achieve what you set out to do?<br>
                        <p>I’m content with the installation, especially if you’d consider that we started with no clue how
                        to turn on a tiny LED pin and ended up creating a ‘sea of luminescent clouds’. I think our group
                        has really tried its best to breakthrough and make progress along the way.
                        It has certainly achieved what we set out to do, in terms of creating a comfy, dreamy cloud
                        environment, allowing users to interact with sensors to create their favourite combination with
                        lights, sounds and visual patterns. During the Expo, we also received a lot of positive
                        feedback. Our participants did have a great time when they experienced our installation.
                        However, I think it still lacks the element of childhood or inner child. The installation was
                        covered by a blanket and included a floor of pillows underneath. But with how it looks at the
                        end, it feels just like a standard setting rather than the blanket/pillow hut that we would
                        build when we were kids. From my point of view, it is not necessary to illustrate all the
                        concepts with 100% how it looks in real life. But if it is one of the “selling points”, then it
                        should be created in a more concrete context.</p><br><br>

                        What is the quality of your product? Try to quantify/objectively express this.<br>
                        <p>In terms of the quality of the product, I would say it is decent but can also be improved.<br>
                        What is in good quality:<br>
                        • Installation built with a solid and safe structure: Although the walls of our installation were
                        made by two tables, they are actually very sturdy and we tested out by using some heavy
                        materials beforehand. We also added more tough wooden blocks at the bottom, so that the angle of
                        table legs are at the same horizontal view. Before placing pillows, we put a stable pallot for
                        support as well.<br>
                        • The combination of LED strips with a layer of cotton works extremely well together. It can
                        certainly bring out the dreamy vibe and our participants all enjoyed seeing its variations.
                        The visual patterns also match well with the cloud and the overall environment. As how they look
                        were abstract, it had the effect of creating a different universe.<br>
                        • Circuit arrangement was highly concerned and therefore we made sure there will not be a short
                        circuit situation.<br><br>

                        What can be improved:<br>
                        <p> • As mentioned in the process chapter, some of our capacitive sensors for changing LED lights did
                        not perform stable. There are a lot of factors that can affect the sensibility, but one thing
                        that we could plan thoroughly is building the circuit that can carry out the best performance.
                        We were not aware of the importance of electronics until the very last moment, thus we couldn’t
                        make adjustments on connecting wires and the position of LED strips.<br>
                        • The sound environment can be taken further into consideration during the Expo: there were lots
                        of different sources of sound during the expo, therefore it could be hard to listen to our own
                        sound options. I also think that we can be clearer in letting participants know how many and
                        which options they can switch per sensor directly. Otherwise they might feel lost with which
                        sound track they were following.</p><br><br>


                        Reflect on the process that you have gone through and compare your work/effort to that of the
                        group<br>
                        <p>During these whole lab weeks, I would say that I had been very honest and open to talk about my
                        concerns, strengths & weaknesses, as well as difficulties that I faced with my groupmates.
                        During the first few days, I see myself needing extra time to understand Arduino than my
                        groupmates. I do not take this as an excuse for not learning, in fact, I also tried to catch up
                        and make sure I understood what the issues were. But compared with Yulia and Hanna, they were
                        actively coming up with the main approach and looking for the problems; whereas my role with
                        Arduino was more like assistant and learner at the same time. On the other hand, I'm also proud
                        of myself for finally getting to understand basic electronics more. Back then, I had zero sense
                        with electricity or didn’t even know how batteries work. But throughout the process, I am able
                        to read up more information, get the logic behind and to think along with the group together to
                        look for a solution.<br>

                        What I took the most responsibilities with were about visuals programming and the installation
                        setup. It was an achievement for me to see how I picked a reference with only a circle to an
                        audio visualizer in the environment, as well as adapting frequency spectrum from the environment
                        in Maakhaven to create a landscape. Although these are the things that were not adapted in our
                        installation, I think I have still gained a lot during the process and have at least tried my
                        best to explore other possibilities on p5js. At the end, I made all 4 visual patterns myself and
                        I used functions that I didn’t even know before lab weeks on 3 of them. Therefore, I would say
                        that I breakthrough a lot in terms of p5js and processing.<br>

                        In terms of installation setup, I understand that our group has a tight budget and didn’t want
                        to spend too much on the project. Therefore, I took a lot of initiatives to help and collect
                        materials around all different places for free, such as the computer monitor, huge chipboard for
                        attaching LED strips, most of the pillows. During the last few days, I also saw wooden blocks of
                        the right size, sanding wood, soldering wires, preparing capacitive sensors and so on.</p><br><br>

                        How did you spend your time, tell something about this?<br>
                        <p>On the first day of the lab weeks, I remember I felt very clueless of how to make a start. I
                        spent some time looking for inspiration but I found it one of the most useful approaches, is to
                        think of things that I have never tried, read the basics, follow instructions along but then
                        expand the basics as much as I can. Therefore, during the first week, I really dived into the
                        things that I’m interested in deeply. I also spent quite a lot of time on tutorials. I think the
                        importance of tutorials isn’t really about following, but to understand the logic and be able to
                        apply them in different contexts later on. When I was watching tutorials, sometimes it also
                        involved other functions that I have never encountered. I’d say that it can actually drag you
                        into an endless coding sea :D<br>

                        As mentioned before, I want to understand what my groupmates were working on and sometimes it
                        might take a longer time for me to achieve that. I'd also bring the issue back home and do
                        research on myself or, of course, ask for an explanation directly.<br>

                        Not just within the group, sometimes I would also walk to other groups and see what they were
                        working on. At the end we had a lot of sharing of how to do this or that and to give advice to
                        each other. For example, I remember me and Yulia just randomly walked to another group and
                        realized that they were figuring out the relation between resistance and temperature. At the end
                        of the conversation, they provided a useful link for us to look into the concept more.</p><br><br>

                        Were you motivated? Were your expectations met? Did you have a good time? Did you learn a lot?
                        Why? Why not?<br>

                        <p>I was motivated most of the time! During the lab week, I get to find my own strengths in visuals
                        and contribute in the way that I can. I really wish that I can work more with LED strips but I
                        think everyone has what they are good at and with teamwork we also need to learn dividing tasks
                        in an efficient way.<br>

                        As for the learning outcome, I would say that I didn’t have the same deep understanding about
                        LED strips and MPR121 capacitive settings in Arduino as Yulia, Hanna and Marissa. We received
                        the MPR board 1.5 days before the expo and I didn't get to experiment with it. It is also more
                        realistic if someone good at it/has been focusing on it to take the initiative to fix the
                        problem. Now thinking back about it, I could have also asked for code sharing and understand
                        more of the setting, rather than just reading up text online. However, as mentioned in earlier
                        paragraphs, I have learned a lot with visual programming and basic knowledge of electronics too.<br>

                        The expectations that I set at the beginning of this course was “I hope I can develop a nice
                        interactive project that is implemented with different technology, together with other talented
                        students together and with the aim of making the users happy”. To see how our users interact
                        with our installation, I think this aim is successfully achieved :) In terms of technology, our
                        group did try to learn new skills that we never tried before and successfully integrated in the
                        installation. I believe there are even more different types of technology, but I'd say that it
                        was already a challenge with what we did and also a good start for us to dive in more in the
                        future.<br>

                        I had a good time in general. It feels rewarding to overcome everything till the end! However,
                        there were also moments that I felt not being respected as a team. There was a situation where I
                        recognized some Dutch words and I can tell that they were discussing one of us. I had to look
                        into their faces and be open for conversation. It is a collaboration and if there is something
                        that you prefer to be done in a different way, it should be voiced out and discussed openly but
                        not complaining in your own language. I also requested for sharing resources that everyone has,
                        but at the end I can feel that most people feel very protective of what they “own”. There are
                        certainly some parts that someone took the most responsibilities and it belongs to their own
                        personal work. I can absolutely understand that, but the reason to share was more about
                        understanding the current progress of the team and being able to reflect from there. The
                        collaboration part at the end was disappointing, but it has also given me a lesson of the
                        importance of listing what we should share together as a team, as well as to encourage more open
                        discussion and check in with what frustrations/concerns the team has.</p><br>
