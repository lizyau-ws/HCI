							<h4>Day 1</h4>
						</b>
						<p>In our first day of lab week, we were being assigned in a group based on the topic (playful
							interaction) we chose. In our group we have 2 UXD & 3 CMD students. Since most
							of us didn't know each other, we spent the morning to get to know each other better and came
							up with our group name together. Based on our background and interests,
							we decided to name our group WingPlay.

							</section>
						</main><br>
						<p>As we want to keep options for what concept we should create for the expo open, we decided to
							first spend some time on our own to different cases and possible technology that we can use,
							as well as inspirations from others. I created a miro board for the group to share
							informations that we found.
						</p>
						<img src="img/labweek/day1/HCI lab weeks.jpg" width="80%"><br>
						<p>Our team name WingPlay gave us some inspirations at some point as well, one of us popped up
							with the
							ideas of clouds and nature. From there, we came up with the thoughts of including different
							sensations in an installation, e.g. what are gonna happen when users interact with the cloud
							or some other object? What are the possible sensations that we can include? What can be the
							response? <br>
							We divided our tasks, where three of our groupmates decided to dive into understanding
							lights & learn how to connect LED stripes with wires together. Yulia & I tried to learn
							about the interaction with the temperature sensor from Arduino. Therefore, we chose NTC
							sensor to measure temperature. However, NTC sensor is actually a thermistor which is a type
							of resistor that its resistance
							is dependent on temperature. In other words, what we read on serial monitor isn't the
							temperature but the resistance value. Because of that,
							I did some research to understand the correlation between resistance and temperature. With
							the below graph, we can see that
							when the temperature increases, resistance decreases. In converse, when temperature
							decreases, resistance increases.<br>
							<img src="img/labweek/day1/log-graph.png" width="80%"><br>
							We first tried to create the relation with temperature and one LED light, i.e. brightness of
							LED changes based on the temperature.
							Then we created different states with two LED lights, i.e. high temperature > green light on
							| red light off; temperature drops to
							a certain degree > green light off | red light on. <br>

								allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
								allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
							Although we managed to make it work, I also realized that after we touched the sensor, it
							takes a fairly long time for the temperature to
							decrease again. It is because the heat that we have given to the sensor when we touched it
							will actually stay on the surface.
							Thinking about it more, i think with measure temperature based on the user's
							input would give a lot of risk as all of us has different body temperature and
							the temperature and weather condition can also affect our body temperature at that moment.
							Therefore, it is difficult to set a "standard" or conditions. It is interesting to learn
							more about NTC sensor, but I personally think it is not
							pratical for our case. It seems like measuring distance or capacitive sensor would make more
							sense. <br><br>
							Afterwards, I tried to catch up what the other part of the group was doing as well. As
							mentioned, 3 of them were learning how to connect LED stripes with wires together.<br>

							<p>From I understood, we can either use a LED light strip connecting clip or by soldering to
								connect wire and the strip together. With the materials we had,
								we went for soldering and it works! This is a nice wrap up of our first day :) </p>

								<h4>Day 2</h4>
							</b>
							<p>In day two, our group continues with what we have on day one. We found that there is a
								library called
								<a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED">FastLED Animation Library</a> for arduino,
								where includes a wide variiety of controlling the light strip in different settings and
								effects. From there, we dived deeper into LED light strips. </p>

							<p>Yulia and Hanna also went outside to check out materials that we might need. They bought
								some cottons to miminc the cloud and also managed to match it with the LED lights!</p>

							<p>At some point, I found it hard that everyone focus on the same type of technology.
								Therefore, we spit again to do more different things which Marissa focused on
								importing sound in processing with capacitive touch. Meanwhile I started to experiement
								more on p5js. <br>
								Since what we did during workshop was mostly about computer vision and capture body
								position by using PoseNet, I thought it might
								be nice to explore other direction such as sound. Therefore, I
								started to understand more all the way from the basic function AudioIn(). Below are
								videos with voice over that show my whole process of what I understand, try out and
								created eventually. Along the way, what I have learned isn't only with getting audio
								from the input of our computer's audio,
								but also how we can visualize the audio and even how can we make the movement smoothly
								by using lerp().

								<h4>Day 3</h4>
							</b>
							<p>In day 3, we worked on capacitive sensors with sound and visual, LED strips and more with
								p5js! Me and Marissa actually spent quite a lot of time figuring out how to implement 2
								capacitive sensors in arduino and connect it with processing. What we learned in the
								workshop was only with one sensor, which is pretty straightforward that there will only
								be one value to send to processing. But when there are two of the same sensors, how can
								we actually differentiate which value belongs to which sensor? Therefore, we tried to
								change the sensor output name as "capA/B" + value. By doing so, we can clearly know that
								the value refers to the capacitive sensor A or B. It might sound very easy here, but we
								were struggled a lot by even how to change the name of sensor output because what we
								need to consider is not only about the "text" or value but rather to convert the integer
								to string. After the naming issue in arduino was solved, we had the next problem which
								is how can we ask processing to identify then? We asked Daniel, the assistant during the
								lab week for advice and he guided us on how to first ask Processing to differentiate
								which sensor has the interaction; then read the value from that sensor and act upon the
								sensor value. The solution of this is to create an array and use split() function to
								break the string into pieces, but also to declare the values as float. To be honest,
								till now I’m still not sure why we have to change it from int to float for that, but we
								only figured out when we tried different possibilities to make the code work.
								#storyofprogramming <br>

								With this whole process, I have come to a point to realize that my groupmates are very
								quick to understand Arduino and coding itself. I can still manage to understand or help
								to some extent, but I feel like they are relatively more capable than me with Arduino. I
								raised my concern to the group and we think it will be the best if i can focus on p5js,
								processing or anything that is related to visuals. This will make the group work more
								efficiently and all-rounded too. Therefore, after me and marissa solved the puzzle of
								setting up multiple capacitive sensors and connected them to processing, I moved on to
								p5js and decided to explore some other possibilities that are related to sound. This
								leaded me to my next experiment - frequency spectrum.
